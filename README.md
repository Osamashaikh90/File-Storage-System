# Decentralized File Storage System

Web-based application for secure file storage on the blockchain

## Overview

The Decentralized File Storage System is a web-based application built on web3 technology that enables users to securely upload and store files on the blockchain. It allows users to access and view their files directly from the browser when connected to the same wallet. Additionally, users can share files with other users by leveraging the allowlist feature, which allows specific addresses to access the shared files. Furthermore, the system provides the ability to disallow specific addresses from viewing the files, ensuring privacy and control over shared content.

## Features

- **File Upload on Blockchain**: Users can upload their files to the blockchain, ensuring their data is securely stored and tamper-proof.

- **Direct Browser Access**: Users can directly access and view their files through a web browser when connected to the same wallet.

- **File Sharing**: Users can share files with other users by adding their addresses to the allowlist, granting them access to the shared content.

- **Allowlist Management**: Users can easily manage the allowlist by adding or removing addresses, controlling who can view the shared files.

- **Privacy and Security**: The system provides privacy and security by allowing users to disallow specific addresses from accessing their files, maintaining control over shared content.
